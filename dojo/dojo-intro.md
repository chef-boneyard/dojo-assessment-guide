# Chef DOJO
## DevOps Journey Assessment

Note:
This is a speaker note for the first slide



# Before We Get Started

1. Purpose
2. Scoping
3. Goal Setting
4. Our Scale
5. Scoring


# Purpose

We need a shared view of where we are and a shared destination 


# Scoping

We focus on a service and the people who provide it.

+ Development
+ Operations
+ Management
+ Architecture
+ Testing
+ Security
+ Compliance
+ Release
+ Support


# Goal Setting

In this exercise, we want to assess your current state. After you have that, we want you to agree to a six month goal.

Note:
We will remind them throughout the assesement that this isn't a "I would like us to be here in 6 months", but rather "we WILL get here in 6 months"


# Our Scale

+ 0 | Not planned
+ 1 | Planned
+ 2 | Inconsistently implemented in some areas
+ 3 | Consistently implemented in some areas
+ 4 | Consistently implemented throughout the organization

Note:
Great idea to have someone in the room copy this to a whiteboard.


# Scoring

The sections of the DOJO each have a few statements. For each section, we will follow this process:

1. Individuals score each statement for current state
2. Group shares scores
3. Group discusses any differing scores
4. Consenus on scores
5. Repeat for the goal

Note:
This follows the agile process of (story sizing or planning poker )
