# DevOps Journey Map
<!-- Insert revised Journey Map picture -->
![alt text](images/journey_map.png)


# The Journey Phases
+ Multiple phases can and should be worked in parallel 
+ The earlier phases evolve significantly as the journey progresses
+ It's natural to skip or inconsistently implement certain phases, so be aware of problems this causes in the later phases

Note:
As you make progress in advanced areas, such as full-stack-automation, the scope of early phases, such as testing, expands
In order to show value quickly, you will sacrifice compeleteness. This is technical debt. Be aware that as you try to improve your system, you will need to go back and clean up. Revisiting is good!

# DOJO Mechanics

1. Safety
2. Scoping
3. Goal Setting
4. Our Scale
5. Scoring


# Safety

This is a safe space. All of you should feel free to share openly and honestly without repercussions.

Note:
Make sure to get explicit support for this from the most senior person in the DOJO.


# Scoping

We focus on a service and the people who provide it.

+ Development
+ Operations
+ Management
+ Architecture
+ Testing
+ Security
+ Compliance
+ Release
+ Support


# Goal Setting

In this exercise, we want to assess your current state. After you have that, we want you to agree to a six month goal.


# Our Scale

+ 0 | Not planned
+ 1 | Planned
+ 2 | Inconsistently implemented in some areas
+ 3 | Consistently implemented in some areas
+ 4 | Consistently implemented throughout the organization


# Scoring

The sections of the DOJO each have a few statements. For each section, we will follow this process:

1. Individuals score each statement for current state
2. Group shares scores
3. Group discusses any differing scores
4. Consenus on scores
5. Repeat for the goal
