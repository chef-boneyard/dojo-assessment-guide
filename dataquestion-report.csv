Values, Code documentation is easy to write and is viewable by all with VCS access, CI jobs automatically update pin and test runtime dependencies of applications, Applications follow a clear promotion path (e.g. Dev -> QA -> Staging -> Production), Regularly scheduled automation demos occur, Every change is reviewed by at least two people with relevant skill and contextual knowledge, Deployments are run during the business day without causing negative user experiences, Application deployment automation performs parallel rolling and/or canary deployments, Applications are deployed without manual intervention, Application deployment automation manages the sequence of deployments (e.g.: Database schema first then app servers), Developers follow code inspection standards (rubocop foodcritic etc.), The codebase is almost always in a releasable state, Software and automation components are shared and co-developed, Any potential contributor to a project can find its code and documentation with minimal assistance, Code reviews are performed and results are shared with developers, Developers suggest and/or provide changes to projects in VCS, All source code is stored in a version control system (VCS), VCS shows who is responsible for each codebase, Developers create new projects in VCS as needed, Developers can view projects in VCS
